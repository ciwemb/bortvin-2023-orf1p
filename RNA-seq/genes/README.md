# Flowchart of data analysis
Run commands listed in 1-Align.txt to align and count reads; output is a series of files named #SAMPLE_mm10_refSeq_rmskReadsPerGene.out.tab
Run MergeCounts.R to create the count matrix named "counts_rna_ribo_annotated.txt".
Run DESeq2_deltaTE.R to calculate differences in translation efficiency of endogenous mRNAs between Mael-mutant and control testes (output file "TE_mael_vs_het_DESeq2.txt"), normalize read counts for RNA-seq (output file "rna_mael_vs_het_DESeq2.txt") and Ribo-seq datasets (output file "ribo_mael_vs_het_DESeq2.txt"), and generate the graph shown in Figure 6D of De Luca C, Gupta A, and Bortvin A. (2023) Ribonucleoprotein condensation driven by retrotransposon LINE-1 sustains RNA integrity and translation in mouse spermatocytes. bioRxiv https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.01.09.523313.
