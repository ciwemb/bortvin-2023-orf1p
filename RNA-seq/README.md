This folder contains the analyses of RNA-seq data for genomic repeats (refer to folder "/repeats"), and for coding genes (folder "/genes"). The annotation file "mm10.UCSC.repeatsAndVariations.gtf" used in these analyses was obtained using the UCSC Table Browser (https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTables). The following table settings were used - clade: Mammal, genome: Mouse, assembly: mm10, group: Variation and Repeats, track: RepeatMasker and table: rmsk. Note: the file used in our analyses was generated on October 2019; the current version of this file (January 2023) contains additional repeat entries.
