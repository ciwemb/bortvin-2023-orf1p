This folder contains the commands to generate the genome indexes files. Files that are needed for this step are: the reference genome sequence (fasta file - "mm10.fa") and the annotation file (gtf file - "mm10_UCSC_refSeq_rmsk.gtf"). "mm10_UCSC_refSeq_rmsk.gtf" file is generated by mergeGTF.pl script; files 
The generates genome indexes are utilized in the STAR mapping steps of both RNA-seq and Ribosome profiling data analyses reported in this repository.
