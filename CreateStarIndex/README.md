This folder contains the commands to generate the genome indexes files. Files that are needed for this step are: the reference genome sequence (fasta file - mm10.fa) and the annotation file (gtf file - ).
The generates genome indexes are utilized in the STAR mapping steps of both RNA-seq and Ribosome profiling data analyses reported in this repository.
