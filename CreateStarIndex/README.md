This folder contains the commands to generate the genome indexes files. Files that are needed for this step are: the reference genome sequence (fasta file - "mm10.fa") and the annotation file (gtf file - "mm10_UCSC_refSeq_rmsk.gtf"). "mm10_UCSC_refSeq_rmsk.gtf" file is generated by the mergeGTF.pl script, where "mm10_UCSC_noAlt.gtf" is the gene annotation file obtained using iGenomes (http://igenomes.illumina.com.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Mus_musculus/UCSC/mm10/Mus_musculus_UCSC_mm10.tar.gz) minus the genes that were present on alternate/random chromosomes, and "chrlist.txt" is a text file containing the chromosome names (chr1, chr2 etc.), with one enrty per row.

The generated genome indexes are utilized in the STAR mapping steps of both RNA-seq and Ribosome profiling data analyses reported in this repository.
